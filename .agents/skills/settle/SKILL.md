## Sploot Anchors

- Product: personal meme library focused on save, semantic search, and shuffle.
- Stack: pnpm Turborepo with `apps/web` (Next.js 15, Clerk, Prisma/Neon pgvector, Vercel Blob, Replicate, Sentry), `apps/extension` (WXT/React Chrome extension), and `packages/common` (shared upload/API contracts).
- Tracker: local markdown files in `backlog.d/`; GitHub Issues are not the source of truth. Active work stays top-level, done work moves to `backlog.d/_done/`.
- Base branch: `origin/master`.
- Load-bearing gate: Ship gate equals CI parity: `pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm --filter web test && pnpm --filter extension build`, with Prisma/pgvector DB-backed paths requiring `DATABASE_URL` against a pgvector-capable Postgres or explicit `DB path unverified` evidence. GitHub CI adds frozen install, `pnpm --filter web db:migrate` against `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`, turbo lint/type-check, web tests, extension lint/test/build, and the `merge-gate` aggregate job.
- Closure signal: move the backlog item to `backlog.d/_done/` with `Status: done`, a `## What Was Built` note, and a conventional commit/PR body carrying `Backlog: backlog.d/<id>-<slug>.md` or explicit `Closes-backlog:` / `Ships-backlog:` trailers.

## How This Skill Works Here

Use /settle to polish an existing branch/PR to merge-ready. It does not merge. Loop through CI, code review, focused refactor, and QA until the branch is clean enough for /ship.

Before calling ready: ensure the backlog reference is structured, the active ticket is either still active intentionally or ready to archive, docs/API/release notes are synced, and the CI parity gate has current evidence. For extension release work, require release checker output and a note on authenticated Chrome/Web Store status.

## Output Contract

End with evidence, decisions, and residual risk. Name exact commands/artifacts for executable paths. If a changed path was not directly exercised, say so explicitly. Keep Sploot-specific terms in the body; do not append generic sidecar notes.
