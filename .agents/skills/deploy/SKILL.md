## Sploot Anchors

- Product: personal meme library focused on save, semantic search, and shuffle.
- Stack: pnpm Turborepo with `apps/web` (Next.js 15, Clerk, Prisma/Neon pgvector, Vercel Blob, Replicate, Sentry), `apps/extension` (WXT/React Chrome extension), and `packages/common` (shared upload/API contracts).
- Tracker: local markdown files in `backlog.d/`; GitHub Issues are not the source of truth. Active work stays top-level, done work moves to `backlog.d/_done/`.
- Base branch: `origin/master`.
- Load-bearing gate: Ship gate equals CI parity: `pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm --filter web test && pnpm --filter extension build`, with Prisma/pgvector DB-backed paths requiring `DATABASE_URL` against a pgvector-capable Postgres or explicit `DB path unverified` evidence. GitHub CI adds frozen install, `pnpm --filter web db:migrate` against `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`, turbo lint/type-check, web tests, extension lint/test/build, and the `merge-gate` aggregate job.
- Closure signal: move the backlog item to `backlog.d/_done/` with `Status: done`, a `## What Was Built` note, and a conventional commit/PR body carrying `Backlog: backlog.d/<id>-<slug>.md` or explicit `Closes-backlog:` / `Ships-backlog:` trailers.

## How This Skill Works Here

Use /deploy for Sploot's two distinct release surfaces. Web deploy is Vercel/production smoke; extension release is Chrome Web Store artifact/listing/submission. Do not conflate them.

Web deploy evidence: GitHub Actions release workflow, Vercel health, `pnpm --filter web smoke:deployed`, Sentry health, and rollback path. Extension release evidence: `pnpm --filter extension build:prod`, `zip:prod`, `release:check`, manifest/zip SHA, listing assets, authenticated Chrome upload/duplicate QA, and Chrome Web Store dashboard receipt.

## Output Contract

End with evidence, decisions, and residual risk. Name exact commands/artifacts for executable paths. If a changed path was not directly exercised, say so explicitly. Keep Sploot-specific terms in the body; do not append generic sidecar notes.
