# /yeet

## Sploot Anchors

- Product: personal meme library focused on save, semantic search, and shuffle.
- Stack: pnpm Turborepo with `apps/web` (Next.js 15, Clerk, Prisma/Neon pgvector, Vercel Blob, Replicate, Sentry), `apps/extension` (WXT/React Chrome extension), and `packages/common` (shared upload/API contracts).
- Tracker: local markdown files in `backlog.d/`; GitHub Issues are not the source of truth. Active work stays top-level, done work moves to `backlog.d/_done/`.
- Base branch: `origin/master`.
- Load-bearing gate: Ship gate equals CI parity: `pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm --filter web test && pnpm --filter extension build`, with Prisma/pgvector DB-backed paths requiring `DATABASE_URL` against a pgvector-capable Postgres or explicit `DB path unverified` evidence. GitHub CI adds frozen install, `pnpm --filter web db:migrate` against `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`, turbo lint/type-check, web tests, extension lint/test/build, and the `merge-gate` aggregate job.
- Closure signal: move the backlog item to `backlog.d/_done/` with `Status: done`, a `## What Was Built` note, and a conventional commit/PR body carrying `Backlog: backlog.d/<id>-<slug>.md` or explicit `Closes-backlog:` / `Ships-backlog:` trailers.

## How This Skill Works Here

Use /yeet to publish local Sploot changes intentionally. Split commits by concern: product code, tests, docs/release evidence, backlog/harness. Use Conventional Commits and include backlog trailers when closing or referencing active work.

Before committing: inspect `git status --short`, avoid staging unrelated user changes, run the appropriate gate slice, and keep web deploy and extension release evidence separate. Never hide failed authenticated/DB/extension QA behind a green lint/typecheck.

## Output Contract

End with evidence, decisions, and residual risk. Name exact commands/artifacts for executable paths. If a changed path was not directly exercised, say so explicitly. Keep Sploot-specific terms in the body; do not append generic sidecar notes.
